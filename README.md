# How I Access Telegram When It’s Blocked Using a Proxy

Being in a region where Telegram is blocked can be really frustrating, especially when you need it for work or staying in touch with friends. Luckily, using a [proxy](https://9proxy.com/) can help you bypass these restrictions effortlessly.

Here’s how it works: A proxy hides your real IP address and makes it appear like you're accessing Telegram from a different location, one where it’s not blocked. Just choose a [proxy server](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123), set it up on your device, and you’re good to go—Telegram will feel like it’s available everywhere.

## Why I Recommend [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123)

I've tried a few options, but [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123) stands out for its fast speeds, reliability, and rotating residential IPs that keep your [connection](https://9proxy.com/) secure. It’s the easiest way I’ve found to access Telegram, no matter where I am.

If you're tired of restrictions, give 9Proxy a try and start using Telegram without limits!
